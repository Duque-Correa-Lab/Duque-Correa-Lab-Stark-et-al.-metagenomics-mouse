#host_specificity_of_trichuris_trichiura

This repository contains the analysis workflow for the manuscript entitled "Host microbiome determines host specificity of the human whipworm, _Trichuris trichiura_".

Abstract: "Long-term whipworm-host co-evolution has resulted in tropism for the caecum of specific hosts, an organ with the densest microbial population in the body. 
Here, we demonstrate that the host specificity of human whipworms (_Trichuris trichiura_) is host microbiome-driven. We successfully establish a _T. trichiura_ infection 
in a non-primate host using a humanised- microbiota mouse model. We further show, in vitro, that hatching of _T. trichiura_ was triggered by mucosal scrapings of the 
caecum of human microbiota-associated mice, but not from wild-type mice, which only induced _T. muris_ hatching. Comparative metagenomic analysis of the murine versus 
humanised microbiomes directly implicated specific bacterial species in _T. trichiura_ egg hatching. Additionally, we demonstrate that host tissue does not directly determine 
host specificity, as _T. trichiura_ readily infected mouse caecaloids. Our findings indicate that host-microbiome-whipworm co-evolution has resulted in exquisite bacterial-whipworm 
egg interactions critical for hatching and development of these parasites in their definitive hosts."
